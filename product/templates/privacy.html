				<h4 class="use-privay"><b>Tips for safe transaction:</b></h4>
				<ul class="privacy-start">
					<li><a href="#"><b>Meet Sellers in person</b><br>
Check out item's quality and make sure it meets your expectations before you make a payment</a></li>
					<li><a href="#"><b>Prepayments are strictly prohibited on fudmarket</b><br>
<b>Buyers</b> - never pay before purchase! You can discuss the cost of delivery, but you can pay for the product only AFTER delivery is done.<br>
<b>Sellers </b>- don't ask for any prepayments before delivery!

</a></li>
					<li><a href="#"><b>Be careful</b><br>
Double check company's background and look through its website before going for an interview. Do not submit any upfront fees for a job application. Do not go to the remote or unfamiliar places for an interview. Do not disclose any personal information like bank account number or your photo copy ID.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#"><b>Use common sense</b><br>
Avoid anything that appears too good to be true, such as unrealistically low prices and promises of quick money.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#"><b>Never give out your financial information</b><br>
Including bank account details, eBay/PayPal info and any other information that could be misused</a></li>
					<li><a href="#"><b>Fake payment services</b><br>
Fudmarket does not offer any payment scheme in purchases. Please</a></li>
					<li><a href="#"><b>Fake fee requests</b><br>
Avoid anyone who asks for extra fees to buy or sell an item or service. Fudmarket never requests payments for its basic services and does not allow items that are not located in Nigeria, so import and brokerage fees should never be required.</a></li>
					<li><a href="#"><b>Requests to use money transfer services</b><br>
Services such as Western Union or MoneyGram are not meant for transactions between strangers and many scams are run through them. Avoid such requests.
